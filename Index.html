            <p>Don't you want to look at these trees? To walk between them and lose yourself in their majesty? Then join the forest! Walk among you barky brethren and fall into the deep joy of an isolation, swallowed by firs, needles, leaves, and stone. Say hello to the squirrels! Maybe not the raccoons though, the trash pandas aren't as friendly as some of our cuter little friends. And, all of it is state funded! So, if your tax dollars are paying for it already, you may as well enjoy it! So, come, join the forest! Remember to breath.... Without that air you'd soon perish.</p>
            <hr />
            <p> Oh, remember those squirrels?! You are, more or less subsidizing those little mad rodents. They may be little better than rats with deseptively fuzzy tails.... But oh can they climb! They climb, jump, fight, and do all manner of squirrly weirdness; watch out! But we have forgeten the great forest rats knownw colloquially as deer. Oh, they are the worst. If you don't believe me, please find Louis C.K's bit on them. You will soon learn why they are truly the worst of all animals... They do cause more human deaths than any other animal, that's a start...</p>
